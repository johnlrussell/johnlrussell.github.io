title: A New Start

Lately, I've been considering how overly complicated my life has become and what I can do to remedy that. Not in a 'does this thing bring me joy' sort of way, but there is too much _noise_; too many distractions and its preventing me from being able to focus on the important stuff. Also, I've realized that I have a strong preference for order, lack of clutter and simplicity and I get very annoyed when things aren't that way (ask my wife.) The thing is, the way that I live doesn't really support that preference, so I'm probably annoyed about 95% of the time (again, ask my wife.)

Obviously, this isn't an overnight sort of change. Small steps are definitely the way to go if I want to keep both myself and family from going crazy. This weekend I tackled my computer and my desk. I think I've organized and minimalized them about as much as I can expect.

Tonight, I'll sit down and plan my week - even what I'm going to wear as well as our meals. The kids are in Florida this week, so this is a perfect time to do that. Over the week, I'm going to work on getting rid of/selling as much of my unused stuff as I can and try to just look at things differently.

Wish me luck.
