title: Time For A Change

I've used [Arch](www.archlinux.org) for years, and I have to admit that I have a love/hate relationship with it. I love the philosophy, but I hate how unpredictable it can be and how seemingly minor updates can completely ruin a weekend. Of course, this doesn't happen very often, but it does happen.

I could change to a different distro such as Debian or CentOS, both of which are significantly more stable than Arch, but still suffer from what I am beginning to realize is the fundamental problem with Linux. That being that Linux is not an operating system - its a kernel. From that kernel, the distros add software from here and there and voil√† you get an GNU/Linux operating system.

FreeBSD, however, is an entire operating system - not just the kernel. FreeBSD controls the whole system - kernel, drivers, utils and documentation, so its a much more focused approach. RSM doesn't like the license, but I can live with it.

So, I'm writing the image to a flash drive now and then the fun will begin. I am positive I can 100% replicate my arch system in BSD, though I think I am going to do a few things differently, such as use [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) instead of i3. I watched [Luke Smith](www.lukesmithxyz) doing some really cool things with dwm, so I am going to give that a shot. In fact, I think I'll probably use as many of the suckless programs as I can.

I don't have any exotic hardware on my desktop - the only thing I think might not work is the bluetooth/wifi, but I don't use either, so if that's all I lose, then I'll be having a good day.
