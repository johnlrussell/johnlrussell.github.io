I live in Atlanta, Georgia with my wife, three children and zero dogs, cats or monkeys. Currently, I am working on my business degree, after which I will immediately begin working on a data science degree.

My first computer was a [Coleco Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleco_Adam) between the cassette decks and the [daisy wheel printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_wheel_printing) I am positive this was the source of my tinnitus. From there I moved on to a [Tandy 1000 EX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000#1000_EX) with 128K of RAM and a 1200 bps modem. Eventually, I got an 8088 clone - still no hard drive, but man you would have been jealous of my floppy disk collection. From there I had a 80286 clone... Thinking on it, I don't think I had a hdd in any of my computers until I got a build an intel 486 box in the mid-90s. That computer had an amazing 1 GB of HDD space. I honestly didn't know how I'd ever fill it.

These days, [my computers](programs.html) are a bit more advanced, but I still am most at home in the terminal. While its useless for some things (like browsing the web or editing images) I find that I can do about 98% of what I want to do in the terminal without some GUI getting in my way.
