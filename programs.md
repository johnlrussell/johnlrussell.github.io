# Hardware
* Desktop: Intel i7-9600K with 32 GB RAM. I have 3 SSDs which are in a volume group for 1.5 TB and 12 TB on my spinners. My video card is an AMD something or other. I used to have 3 monitors, but these days, I just use a single 32" Dell IPS monitor
* Laptop: Thinkpad T440 with 8 GB RAM, a 480 GB SSD and 500 GB HDD.

# Software
<ul>
<li>I tend to prefer console apps to graphical ones. I find that graphical apps tend to either get in my way or be too distracting to actually get anything done. About the only graphical app I use these days is my web browser. I don't think I used a GUI until I had already been using computers for more than 10 years, so that probably explains some of it.</li>

### Operating System

I use [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) on both my laptop and desktop. I have a strong preference for [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org). Unfortunately, I do need some non-free blobs to actually be able to use my computers, or I'd probably use [Parabola GNU/Linux](https://parabola.nu). Other than a few games, I do not use any proprietary software on my computers.

Here is a quick rundown of the software that I use:
**Terminal** - st (simple terminal) by [suckless.org](https://suckless.org) Its very lightweight and customizable.

**Window Manager** [i3-gaps](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/I3) I don't use a full-fledged desktop environment like XFCE, KDE or Gnome _(please, for the love of everything holy, do not pronounce Gnome as Ga-Nome around me)_ For my status bar, I use i3blocks.

**Text Editor** [neovim](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Neovim)

**Web Browser** [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org) only as I am growing increasingly concerned about Chrome. I also use surf by [suckless.org](https://suckless.org)

**Mail Client** [mutt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mutt)

**Video Player** mpv.

**Documents** I write documents in LaTeX and compile them into pdf documents.

**Presentations** [suckless sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/)

**Spreadsheets** [sc-im](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im) (its also in the AUR) The amount of enjoyment I get out of this should be illegal.
